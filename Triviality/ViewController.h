 Build a simple trivia app, which asks the user a question and then presents a series of multiple-choice answers
 When the user selects the correct answer, they should be taken to the next question
 When the user selects an incorrect answer, they should receive a message indicating they got the question wrong, and have the option to try again
 Your app should include a minimum of 5 questions, and should show the user their score at the end of the game
 Bonus: When the user guesses correctly, the background color should turn green for 1-2 seconds; if the user guesses incorrectly, the background color should flash red for 1-2 seconds
